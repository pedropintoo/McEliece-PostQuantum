# Simple McEliece and Niederreiter Cryptosystems in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems, two public-key cryptosystems that are well-suited for post-quantum cryptography scenarios.

**Disclaimer:** This code is provided for educational purposes only!

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020a or later recommended)

## Content
 - `*/keygen.m` - Key Generation for both cryptosystems
 - `McEliece/mcEliece.m` - McEliece public-key cryptosystem
 - `Niederreiter/niederreiter.m` - Niederreiter public-key cryptosystem
 
## Inspiration
Inspired by "Application of MATLAB in Practical Teaching of Post-Quantum Cryptography" by Aleksei Vambol.
